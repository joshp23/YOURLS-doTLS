# YOURLS-doTLS [![Listed in Awesome YOURLS!](https://img.shields.io/badge/Awesome-YOURLS-C5A3BE)](https://github.com/YOURLS/awesome-yourls/)
Always use SSL/TLS for a destination url in YOURLS if available

#### Function:
This plugin will upgrade links to SSL/TLS when 

- adding new links
- redirecting short links
- checking link stats
- etc.

#### Installation
Works with YOURLS 1.7.3(+) or YOURLS 1.7.2(-?)

As any YOURLS plugin:

- Extract the `doTLS` folder in this archive into `user/plugins/`
- Enable in the admin interface.

#### Note:
This may cause some small delays on page loads in the admin interface if there are a lot of links to check. This _should_ pass.
